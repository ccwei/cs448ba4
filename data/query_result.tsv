"I understand the secrecy but I wanted to see more evidence that you've been testing the business model. I also didn't get enough of here's the basic prototype that we showed to potential customers and their reaction was X and so this is how we changed it. The business model and path to consumer adoption are still unclear."	"Mostly how to acquire customers, how many email signups did you get? Did you try marketing experiments? What kind of tests have you run on the revenue model? Can you really get affiliate fees?"	"This is a huge, important market. I think if you nail the product then it could do quite well. Would have loved to have seen some screenshots from how the app would look and what features it would have in it based on customer feedback. More analysis of different marketing strategies as distribution and customer acquisition are key challenges."	5.6	49	26647	1	5250	5250	3	"Web Technologies"	"Consumer Products"	562	37212

In addition, I would try to talk with a few partners and figure out exactly how you will get paid and what it takes to get this type of lead gen partnership done."

What kind of actual cost savings do they get out of it, can they be a reference client?"	"There is the formal organizational structure and there is the informal structure. Does the informal structure matter more and can you really change it and produce a big productivity enhancement in the company. I get that you can in theory but what about in practice?"	"There likely is a big need for this but I think convincing a lot of companies to buy it and to implement the changes will be more time consuming and costly than you're currently estimating.

Angry birds the best selling game in the app store \"only\" made 50 million dollars. And they sold a lot of it. Regularly a good app is around 1 million. But the app is really good as marketing campaign (Most of the revenue in angry birds comes from merchandising)."	"How are you going to partner with the music firms?

How thorough were your customer interviews?"	"You might consider incoroporating a dietician section, where people can meet up with a dietician to plan their meals or diet.

Is there more differentiation than 'Modern Game Design and Play Options\"?  Will you be unique in this or can you be copied.

To that extent this team is working on addressing a problem that needs solving"	"Is there some reason that the large travel websites aren't already offering this service as an add-on? For instance, if this was such a burning problem, lonelyplanet.com or one of the hundreds of websites would have already integrated booking, trip planning, etc. on their existing websites. So, the question to ask yourself is: is this really such a big problem, or is the market size insignificant to the extent that established websites don't consider it worthwhile exploring this niche"	"What is your user acquisition cost?
Is your per user acquisition cost greater than the revenues they will generate for you? For instance if the CPC for your niche on Google Adwords is $29, but each user generates an average of $25 of revenues for your business, then you're actually losing $4 per customer. Maybe you've validated this, but I wasn't able to see this information on the presentation, which is why I ask."

Sections for:

- trying to get pregnant
- 1st trimester
- 2nd trimester
- 3rd trimester
- 6 months post (Dads/Moms)
- 12 months post.

Essentially a large social network community for the soon-to-be and pregnant couples.

- There could be forum or question base posts like Quora. 
- This can prevent overlap with questions for the MDs.

- Allow each member can have an account. 
- Their account can show their progress in their pregancacy (pre/1st/2nd/3rd trimester/just born).
You can use gamification aspects similar to Duolingo to encourage uses to be more active, track their progress, help and encourage out others.

Eating out is typically a group activity. It is very unlikely that all people in a group who are going out are diabetic. If you market your joint as a diabetic food joint then you are discouraging normal healthy people from going there, and you are forcing diabetic people to go there alone to eat which is not going to happen. I think the marketing should focus on healthy eating with special meals for diabetic/hypertension and other disease patients.

There are two key challenges for your idea :- 
1. Creating tasty meals which are also healthy. I can not say much about this but I do not see any discussion on this in your reports. 
2. Creating a really solid marketing campaign, since food joints are in abundance and people do not really care much about their health when eating out. Unfortunately  it seems you guys have not spent much time on this aspect. "	"1. How will you reach your target audience?

The way they have differentiated from other travel sites is that instead of simply showing all options to the user, they first ask for the user's requirements and then let other travel agents provide deals on those requirements.

Consider this for risk: only 2 out of 475 apps do something with sound. Do you find something strange about that? Is it possible that people just don't care for this functionality? Is it because implementing something like this is far too involved (either technically, or financially)? Is it because people have tried in the past and failed? How can you be sure you're not making mistakes that other people haven't already made? Please evaluate this criteria so that you're mitigating your risks early..."

Engage friends to do as a driver, and do it yourself when you commute. Start very localized and expand.

If the route could be profitable for a taxi, why not for individuals who wish to earn something? Try to engage who wants to make money first, they will wait for the service to start. Can validate this with a little survey. But check that those earnings are legal, first, or the whole business is gone.

You attracted 2 mentors!"	"Fierce competition in this field, I think you are overestimating your competitive edge.

If keyword search was more effective than categorization, competition would have already implemented it.
In particular, if users have to search by themselves again, just to find results into a smaller set of providers (will they be the best?) they won't see the advantage.

Market size analysis and marketing analysis are not shown in the pitch. Would like e.g. to see more backing numbers and methodology for user acquisition cost assumptions.

I think you tested more the paying users side, but you should test more what you sell... the customers side.

In a global market, \"friends\" opinion may be irrelevant. Have you a user relation mechanism though? Maybe better to claim \"other users\" opinion, or to start locally.

The overall business model is a bit confusing, not easy to catch the key differentiating points at a glance.

When the provider is selected by data, e.g. as the cheaper, e.g. for travel ticketing, you need field semantics. Generic search becomes useless.

Surveyed people may have given positive feedback, thinking of a 'magic app', but may be disenchanted by actual results. E.g. I do not believe you'll find the cheaper travel ticketer. Need to get feedback from the demo usage ASAP.

Competition analysis lacks completely. I do not see the difference from a yellow pages service with an internal search engine (possibly backed by Google for free on its domain)."	"Why shall customers search for service providers? It's easier if they post the need, and SP get in touch with offerings. At least this would shift you from the yellow pages to the marketplace (e.g. elance.com) model.

Same goes for video. 

I very much want a short, fact / topic oriented first orientation for the beginning and something to quickly scan afterwards to be able to make categorizations and decisions on where to place you. 

I would put the most salient issues in the top left corner and use the space below for the scanning / slide replacement part given that you want to work with a video.

Then we can talk about 20min videos - that is if I am interested.

Personally, I want slides because I am a visual person - if others like the video, fine!

I would want to get an impression of the website with the hassle of registering first. 

After scanning and trying to figure it out I have just a feeling of what you want to do. "	"Did you develop the software already in full or a part of it and/or mockups?

In the first assignments for this class my team made 
some questions to help evaluate the business models.
The best of this questioners where:
1) Can this business become profitable in 3 months ?
Many start-ups fail if they can't start to earn money in 3 months time.

2) Does this business have an business edge ? 
This means if the business have an advantage that 
other business in there market can't copy or replicate.
It might be a special patented technology, a secret recipe, 
an unique brand, a big user base, special resources or property.   

3) Does the business have a strategy for building passive income ?
Passive income is income that you don't have to work for, 
there might be an initial investment in time and money but 
after that only minimal maintainers should be necessary. 
Example on passive income is rent, dividend or subscription.

In the first assignments for this class my team made 
some questions to help evaluate the business models.
The best of this questioners where:
1) Can this business become profitable in 3 months ?
Many start-ups fail if they can't start to earn money in 3 months time.

2) Does this business have an business edge ? 
This means if the business have an advantage that 
other business in there market can't copy or replicate.
It might be a special patented technology, a secret recipe, 
an unique brand, a big user base, special resources or property.   

3) Does the business have a strategy for building passive income ?
Passive income is income that you don't have to work for, 
there might be an initial investment in time and money but 
after that only minimal maintainers should be necessary. 
Example on passive income is rent, dividend or subscription.  
What can you add to fulfill this questions ?

What is needed is a system of governance that is above the individuals making up the management structure so that ideals of euqlity can rule the society.  Otherwise the community will last only as long as its idealistic founding members.

Not sure if the online version could be as engaging for kids as the whiteboard. How communication would happen? I think that meeting face-to-face is more educative than delegating an app to draw commands and fly away as a parent...
I think you could get more success through a board game, which may fit with Christmas presents more than an app. This would solve your lack of time and skills"	"Can the team make the job done? Is there a reward game for them? :P

In the first assignments for this class my team made 
some questions to help evaluate the business models.
The best of this questioners where:
1) Can this business become profitable in 3 months ?
Many start-ups fail if they can't start to earn money in 3 months time.

2) Does this business have an business edge ? 
This means if the business have an advantage that 
other business in there market can't copy or replicate.
It might be a special patented technology, a secret recipe, 
an unique brand, a big user base, special resources or property.   

3) Does the business have a strategy for building passive income ?
Passive income is income that you don't have to work for, 
there might be an initial investment in time and money but 
after that only minimal maintainers should be necessary. 
Example on passive income is rent, dividend or subscription.

Also, it would be better if the team had a video which demonstrates how complex systems work and a more detailed explanation of what can be inferred from the data their graphs show. 

I also think that the team should have determined how many companies are currently employing complex systems to analyze problems the company is facing.
