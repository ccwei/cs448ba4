Peer reviews are important and commonly used in many project-based classes. In
massive online open classrooms (MOOCs), the data from peer review process is
huge and it becomes very difficult to explore and understand. Our goal is to
design a visualization tool for large-scale peer review exploration which helps
course instructors to understand and gain insights from the peer review
activities, the engagement of students, and the quality of the reviews. We
utilize existing text visualization techniques as well as multi-view
coordination and enable the navigation through score distributions and the text
feedbacks.

\section{Introduction}
Massive open online courses(MOOCs) including Khan Academy, Udacity, Coursera and
Venture Lab are increasing in numbers. \cite{nytimes} One emerging challenge is
how to scale assessment to these high student-teacher ratio environments.

Using peer review system \cite{cpr} to evaluate students’ work is one possible solution.
However, in the massive online courses,
the number of reviews done in each class is large and it is overly difficult
and time-consuming for instructors to get a comprehensive understanding
of the review of each task.

To address this problem, we developed Peereviz, a peer review exploration tool
on top of Venture Lab platform. It aims for helping instructors to understand
the massive amount of peer review results. The design goal of the tool is to
create a visualization tool that helps course instructors in three ways:
1) get the overall understanding of peer review activities;
2) be able to dive into specific part of the review results;
3) quick browse and select higher quality reviews to read.

As a data explorer, it follows "overview first, zoom and filter, then details-
on-demand" mantra. \cite{overviewfirst}


The paper organization is as follows.
We first summarize previous work in peer review system and visualization.
We then describe the peer review data we used.
Next, we present our design and visualization techniques,
followed by the evaluation and feedbacks from users.
Finally, we suggest the possible directions for future work
and then summarize our work.

\section{Related Work}

A number of studies has confirmed the usefulness of the peer review system
to the students in various domains including programming and writing class
\cite{MyPeerReview,WebBasedPeerReview}.


However, to the best of our knowledge, work that combine visualization techniques
to help instructors understand peer review data is still limited.
The only work we discovered is  an interactive tool for peer-review exploration
proposed by Xiong et al. \cite{xiong}
They primarily work on the improvement of semantic information
to help instructor discover interesting patterns and
compare different groups of student in the writing class on SWoRD system \cite{Cho2007}.
In contrast to the prior work, we mainly focuses on the visualization
and interaction design for exploring multi-dimensional peer review data
in the recently emerging large-scale online classrooms.

different?: focus on multiview, navigation, qualitative + quantitative feedback

The top part shows the quantitative feedbacks which are score ranging
from Low (1) to High (10) while the bottom part shows the feedback capture grid
which a form where the reviewers give their opinions
on four different aspect: notable, constructive, questions, and ideas.}
\label{fig:review-form}
\end{figure}


\section{Data Set Description}
We use a sample data set from a final project peer review result in the Spring
2012 Entrepreneurship class on the Venture Lab platform. A total of 1,206 peer
reviews are collected, which consists of 116 teams being reviewed and 212
individual reviewers. For privacy reasons, the team names are anonymized and we
presented team description as much as needed. The actual peer review form has
two parts, including (1) multiple quantitative score ranging from low(1) to
high(10) for different aspects of the final project and (2) qualitative text
feedback, which utilizes a feedback capture grid \cite{dbootcamp} where
reviewers could express their opinions in four dimensions–what they
like(\emph{notable}), constructive criticisms (\emph{constructive}), questions
they have about the work (\emph{questions}), and any additional ideas for the
project (\emph{ideas}).

\subsection{Team Browser}
The team browser serves as the main part of the overview
where we can select one or multiple teams using different ways of filtering.

\subsection{Review Browser}

The review browser shows data from the selected team(s) in the team browser. If
user has not selected any team in the team browser,  the review browsers also
provide overview by showing aggregated data of all teams.
